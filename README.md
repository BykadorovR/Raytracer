[![ClangFormat](https://github.com/BykadorovR/Raytracer/actions/workflows/clang-format-check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BykadorovR/Raytracer/actions/workflows/clang-format-check.yml)

This project is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Android) graphic engine utilizing the Vulkan API, offering a comprehensive set of features to facilitate the development of visually compelling applications. The engine includes support for terrain rendering, various lighting models, particle systems, skeletal animation and more.

# Structure

- **dev/master** branch contains classic rasterization engine
- **raytracing** branch contains Path Tracer with importance sampling using compute shader
- [samples](samples) set of samples which demonstates how to use the engine with description and videos
